TheEWay
=======

This is a small script that calculates the sum from x=1 to x=n of 1/x. It uses an unproven formula for optimization, which appears to work rather well.

Usage
=====

Calculating the sum of x=1 to x=1000 of 1/x:

	$ ruby TheEWay.rb 
	n= 1000
	Sum to 700 = 7.1290105045 to 7.1290105045
	Sum to 1904 = 8.1291908515 to 8.1291908515
	Calculating actual value...
	Progress: 0%  
	Sum to 1000 = 7.485471249459114 to 7.485471249459114
	$
